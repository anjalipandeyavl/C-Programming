		Dynamic Memory allocation
		-------------------------
		
		Memory allocation : Memory allocation is the technique of allocating partial or complete memory of a computer for the program or process.
		There are two ways to allocates a memory : 
			a) Static Memory allocation
			b) Dynamic Memory allocation
			
In case of static memory allocation , memory allocation is fixed in advance, whether that amount of memory comes in use or not, the extra memory blocks results in waste of memory.

In case of dynamic memory allocation, memory is allocated at run time by C library function, which are present in #include<stdlib.h>.The library functons are : 
	a) malloc() 
	b) calloc()
	c) realloc()
	d) free()
